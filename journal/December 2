We learned a lot about how memory works on a pc.
The class started with interesting facts about memory and how the collumination works. 
We learned about bytes and the relation of CPU to other programs.
In addition, we used an LED display for the first time. In my group we divided into 3 groups: Me and someone else worked on the curcuit,
someone worked on the flow diagram and another person worked on the program.
After some sturggle we finally manage to do it.
